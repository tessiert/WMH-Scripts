# WMH Scripts (Python, Bash, and Matlab)
- This is the full-blown repository containing the data processing and analysis scripts constituting the pipeline I developed to take raw MRI data and: perform necessary file translations and cleanup operations, apply both standard and custom corrections, calculate noise measures and various statistics, and compare, contrast, and enhance the results of common White Matter Hyperintensity (WMH) segmentation algorithms as applied to MRI brain scans.  Most of these routines are preliminary steps and/or experimental tools that (in different combinations) produce output suitable for subsequent analysis using the higher level tools (and the ones I suspect will be of most immediate interest to people) presented in my [MRI-Tools](https://github.com/tessiert/MRI-Tools) repository.

- Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions regarding the purpose or necessity of any of the preliminary steps implemented here.
